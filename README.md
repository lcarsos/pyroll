PYROLL
======

Just a quick matplotlib thing I threw together to see the probabilities of
various dice rolls.

usage: 
```
./pyroll_graph.py <number of rolls to sim> [<dice>]
```
eg. To do 10000 rolls of a d20, d10, and d4
```
./pyroll_graph.py 10000 20 10 4
```

Requires
======== 
* Python 3 
* Matplotlib 
* Numpy 
* Probably something else that I take for granted on my systems
